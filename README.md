# Review Queue

**Note** This Action requires that you have access the [new projects beta](https://github.blog/2021-06-23-introducing-new-github-issues/). It is not compatible with the classic Projects product.

Do you ever wish you had just one place to look for Pull Requests that need review? This action adds reviewable Pull Requests to a specified Project board and removes non-reviewable Pull Requests. So when you are ready, you just have one Project board full of Pull Requests that need review.

What constitutes a reviewable Pull Request? A Pull Request that is neither closed nor merged nor in a draft state. This action runs on various Pull Request and Pull Request Review events to determine if the related Pull Request should be added or removed from the designated Project.

## Inputs

#### `project-owner`

**Required** The name of the organization that owns the project. Default `"github"`.

#### `project-number`

**Required** The number of the review queue project, e.g. `42`.

#### `flagged-in-users`

A comma separated string of user handles who are opted into this action, e.g. `"nat,defunkt"`

#### `debug`

A boolean representing whether you want to log lots of debugging information into the action output.
